What I did first was get rid of any major "Div Class" with another syntax on line 12,30,34,58,82.
Made changes to the CSS to correspond with the new syntaxes. 
Also adjusted the aside padding from 20px to 18px to be in line with the section as it pertruded below it.
Changed the class of <img src="./assets/images/online-reputation-management.jpg"> on line 43 to float-left, to make the picture be on the left and text on the right. As I felt it was too heavy on the right side with it being right next to the second aside picture.
Changed the color of the letters "s,e,o" to make the clever business name have some character and to highlight what this company's focus is.
Gave all images alt attributes.
Overal organization of the code as well.
